# 3500SEF-group-project

This repository now contains only the React (Vite) frontend.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173
```

## Project Structure

```
webApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vite.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Notes

- All backend/serverless code and docs have been removed per request.
- If you deploy to AWS Amplify, connect only the `frontend` build with the default Vite build settings.

## Deploy (Optional)

If you want to host the frontend statically (e.g., AWS Amplify or Netlify), build it first:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
# output in frontend/dist
```

You can then upload the contents of `frontend/dist` to any static hosting service.
