# Backend (Demo)

This folder contains a minimal offline HTTP server to simulate AWS Lambda + API Gateway while developing the React frontend.

- Run offline server: `npm start` (listens on http://localhost:7071/api)
- Lambda-style handlers are in `src/handlers/` and can be used with Serverless Framework or AWS SAM later.
